## Recap and setup

. . .

- We started off this unit with basic explanation of how institutions make policy
- We then examined the constitutional bases and actual processes of interbranch relations
  + American public policy is built by *all* our institutions
- We also surveyed political science research on how separation of powers plays out
- Today we'll bring it back full circle and put it all together

## An overview of American policymaking

. . .

- The public and activists or interest groups are policy demanders
  + Public opinion changes or events create a need
  + Some members of the public are more motivated than others
  + Interest groups represent business interests and politically engaged citizens,
    and can make policy demands more efficiently and effectively
- Each institution has policy making tools to meet that demand
  + Congress legislates
  + Bureaucrats regulate
  + Courts issue judgments and precedents
  + Presidents issue executive orders and influence bureaucrats
  + These processes interact to generate policy
- Public opinion and activist pressure then generate feedback

## Public opinion and institutions' decisions

. . .

- Policy feedback ([Campbell and Levi 2012](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/apl7st/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1126522091); Week 8, Day 1)
- Thermostatic opinion [(Soroka and Wlezien 2012)](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/apl7st/cdi_proquest_ebookcentralchapters_471996_14_36)

## The role of organized interests

. . .

- What are interest groups and lobbyists?
- How do they pursue their members' or clients' interests?
  + *Amici* at the Court
  + Participation in bureaucratic rulemaking
  + Traditional lobbying with other politicians

## The importance of regulation

. . .

- Policy analysts and scholars often use game theory in their work, which can be useful for showing the benefit of regulation
  + This is obviously not a game theory class
  + All you need to know is a game theory model
    * consists of players, their preferences, and the actions they can take, and
    * its solution is a strategy for every player that is the best possible response to every other player's strategy

## The importance of regulation

- Consider the following scenario:
  + You live with a roommate & must split cleaning duties
  + You each prefer a clean space but also dislike cleaning
  + It can be rational not to contribute even if you'd be better off with a clean space
  + Regulation can solve such problems

## Models of change

. . .

- "There is an old saw in political science that difficult conditions become problems only when people come to see them as amenable to human action" [(Stone 1989)](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/apl7st/cdi_gale_incontextcollege_GICCO_A7823693)
- "social construction of target populations... influence the policy agenda and the selection of policy tools..." [(Schneider and Ingram 1993)](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/apl7st/cdi_proquest_journals_214433416)
- Punctuated equilibrium [(True, Jones, and Baumgartner 2007)](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/apl7st/cdi_informaworld_taylorfrancisbooks_10_4324_9780367274689_6_version2)
  + Issue definition
  + Agenda setting and bounded rationality

## Exam Prep: Essay

. . .

Suppose the President of the United States decided to immediately deport every unauthorized immigrant in the United States.
Further suppose that Congress immediately passed legislation allowing said immigrants to stay in the United States.
An affected immigrant sues, seeking an injunction to prevent the President from enforcing their policy.
The case reaches the Supreme Court; as if you were the justice writing the Court's opinion, explain why the President's action would be constitutional or unconstitutional.

. . .

- How does this fit into Justice Jackson's typology from *Youngstown*?
- In light of that, how should we analyze the hypothetical?
