## The first American government

. . .

- Americans developed a number of grievances against the crown
- In 1774 the colonists organized the First Continental Congress \ssl
  + It petitioned the King for redress of grievances\onslide<5->{, but}
  + were largely unsuccessful
- In 1775 a Second Continental Congress met \ssl
  + Authorized the Declaration of Independence
  + Served as de facto government during & after the Revolution
  + Drafted the Articles of Confederation
- The Articles were formally ratified in 1781, becoming our first Constitution

## The weakness of confederation

. . .

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}}
\toprule
\multicolumn{1}{c}{Virginia Plan} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{New Jersey Plan} \\
\midrule
Bicameral legislature & Unicameral legislature \\[0.1em]
Population apportionment & Equal suffrage for states \\[0.1em]
Single executive & Executive council \\[0.1em]
Robust judiciary & Scaled-back judiciary \\[0.1em]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
}
- A "Great Compromise" was reached \ssl
  + Bicameral legislature with one house apportioned on population and the other with equal suffrage for states
  + Single executive, but elected via Electoral College instead of appointed by Congress
  + Judiciary closer to the Virginia Plan

## Ratification

. . .

- The Constitution needed to be ratified by the states
- Some quickly ratified it, but in others there was a fierce debate
- Supporters were called Federalists, opponents called Anti-Federalists
- Federalists & Anti-Federalists disagreed on many issues\onslide<6->{, like}\ssl
  + Bill of Rights
  + Federal judiciary
- They each published essays making their case
- Enough states ratified by September 1788, and the new government was elected in early 1789
