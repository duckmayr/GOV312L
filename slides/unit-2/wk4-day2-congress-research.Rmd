## Intro to Political Science Research

. . .

-   Political science has developed a lot over the years
-   Now it is mostly empirical and theoretical research
-   Reading articles can tricky without methods training

## Reading Political Science Articles

. . .

-   I recommend the following reading order for you:
    -   Abstract
    -   Introduction
    -   Conclusion
    -   Look at the figures
    -   Skim the rest
-   You'll get a sense of their findings & rough sense of methods

## Reading Articles: Details of Interest

. . .

-   What question are they trying to answer?
-   Can you tell what the prior literature said?
-   What's can you understand about the data they're using & how?
-   What are their results?
-   What are some implications?
    -   For the real world?
    -   For future research?
-   Is there anything you doubt about the study?

<!-- Ideology (NOMINATE vs GGUM) -->

## Political Ideology

. . .

-   We're all familiar with a left-right political continuum
-   But how would we measure it & place politicians in that space?
-   Typical approach is to use voting data\only<5-6>{, a response matrix:}

```{=tex}
\only<2-3>{
\vspace*{7.5\baselineskip}
\begin{figure}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node [left]  at (-2, 0) {Liberal};
    \node [right] at ( 2, 0) {Conservative};
    \draw [{Straight Barb}-{Straight Barb}, thick] (-1.8, 0)--(1.8, 0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
}
```
```{=tex}

```
```{=tex}

\multicolumn{1}{c}{$\vdots$}    & $\cdots$  & $\cdots$ & $\ddots$ & $\vdots$ \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
}
```
```{=tex}

## So What?

. . .

- Members of Congress tend to care about policy
- Many formal models and empirical analyses of Congress use left-right ideology
- Many formal models and empirical analyses use left-right ideology in separation of powers research

<!-- - Accountability and Representation:            15 minutes -->

## Accountability and Representation

. . .

- We want a government that does what we want
- How can we accomplish that?
  + Representatives who represent us, or our interests
  + Holding elected representatives to account
 
<!-- Representation -->
## Representation

. . .

- We elect Representatives; what does representation mean?
- Trustee vs Delegate Model
- Descriptive representation vs substantive representation
- Dyadic representation vs Collective Representation
- What does research say about these different models?

## Trustee vs Delegate Model of Representation

. . .

- A "delegate" follows the wishes of their constituents while a "trustee" follows their own judgment [(Hill et al 2015, Chapter 1)](https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/core/books/representation-in-congress/08187CD0C236C734902414E4C2582551)
- Members of Congress tend to use a trustee approach [(Cavanagh 1982)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/447976?sid=primo&seq=2)

## Descriptive vs Substantive Representation

. . .

- Descriptive representation occurs when representatives share your personal characteristics
- Substantive representation occurs when your representatives faithfully represent your policy preferences
- There's some evidence that descriptive representation $\rightarrow$ substantive representation [(Lowande et al 2019)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/45132502?sid=primo)\only<5>{\dots}
- ...but also evidence that descriptive representation reduces constituents perception of policy incongruence [(Jones 2016)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/26612345?sid=primo)

## Dyadic vs Collective Representation

. . .

- We often think about how *our* representative represents us
- But in the aggregate, we could still be adequately represented [Weissberg (1978)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/1954109)
- There's some hope for dyadic representation as well, depending on the political context [Blumenau (2020)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/full/10.1111/lsq.12291)
  
<!-- Accountability -->
## Accountability: Adverse Selection & Moral Hazard

. . .

- Electoral accountability requires ability to find someone better
- Voters are faced with a *moral hazard* problem
  + Once in office, can break campaign promises
  + Sometimes able to conceal their actions
- They are relatedly faced with an *adverse selection* problem
  + Voters don't know politicians' true ideology
  + This can make it hard to find better alternatives
- There is a *vast* literature on modeling these problems
  + Very technical but thorough review: [Duggan and Martinelli (2017)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A0SFDOsaj-PrEVewK3ZDrogJD0HlcvQN/view)
  + Some optimistic results: Repeated elections mitigate commitment problems [(Duggan and Martinelli 2017)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A0SFDOsaj-PrEVewK3ZDrogJD0HlcvQN/view)
  + Some pessimistic results: This falls apart with "last term effects" ([Duggan 2016](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/science/article/pii/S0022053116301247); [Ferraz and Finan 2011](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/23045899?sid=primo))

<!-- - Congressional Procedure:                      15 minutes -->
## Congressional Procedure

. . .

- Congress sets its own procedural rules (Article I \S\ 5)
- Parties can use procedure for agenda control [(Cox and McCubbins 2004)](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/utxa/detail.action?docID=321239&pq-origsite=primo)
  + Put things on the agenda that they want
  + Take things off the agenda to protect members
- Can use procedure like conference committees to move policy [(Vander Wielen and Smith 2011)](https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2011.603018)
- Can affect things other than outcome, like timing [(Smith et al 2013)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/42703799?sid=primo&seq=24)
- Development of procedural rules is important for understanding their operation ([Binder 1997](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/be14ds/alma991019252259706011); [Binder 2006](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/40263401?sid=primo))

## Chamber Leaders

. . .

- Speaker of the House
  + Speakers enjoy important agenda control powers
  + Strong Speakers have spurred changes in congressional institutions [(Davidson 1998)](https://doi-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/10.4324/9780429499029)
- Committees
  + Investigations
  + Involvement in policy
    * Lesser role than the past
    * But still play an important role [(Becker and Moscardelli 2008)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/20452113?sid=primo&seq=2)

## The Filibuster

. . .

- The filibuster is not constitutionally mandated <!-- add history -->
- Some suggest it broadens winning coalitions, though there's some evidence to the contrary [(Madonna 2011)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00491.x)
- There is a **large** literature on the filibuster
  + It plays a role in many models of policymaking [(e.g. Krehbiel 1998)](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/be14ds/alma991024531109706011)
  + Many argue it prevents the Senate from doing its job ([Binder and Smith 1996](https://web-p-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=8cd63821-ba21-4ea9-9af9-1e51b94641a3%40redis&vid=0&format=EB); [Smith 2014](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/permalink/01UTAU_INST/be14ds/alma991039271669706011))
  + SCOTUS nomination changes has increased [(Bird and McGee 2023)](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X221109534)
  
## Broader Confirmation Literature

. . .

- Changes in confirmation votes over time [(Epstein et al 2006)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00407.x?sid=primo)
- Strategic delay [(Binder and Maltzman 2002)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/3088422)
- Public opinion
  + General [(Kastellec et al 2010)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/10.1017/s0022381610000150?sid=primo)
  + Polarization and substantive representation [(Kastellec et al 2015)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/10.1086/681261?sid=primo)
  + Descriptive representation [(Badas and Stauffer 2018)](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/26600455?sid=primo)
  + Legitimacy [(Rogowski and Stone 2021)](https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-political-contestation-over-judicial/docview/2543259162/se-2?accountid=7118)

<!-- - Additional topics and conclusion:              5 minutes -->

## Addtional Topics

. . .

- Parties in Congress (covered later)
- Lobbying
- Congressional Approval
- Interaction with other branches (covered later)
- Network effects
- Districting
- Campaigns

## Conclusion

. . .

- Congress has a limited grant of power
  + **but** the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce and Necessary & Proper Clauses is expansive
  + can gain additional powers through amendment
  + Congress also has the inherent power to investigate
- The electoral connection is key to understanding Congress
- Public opinion and Members' own ideology plays a huge role
- There are limits to our ability to be represented and hold representatives to account, though there are also optimistic results
- Members can use Congressional procedure powerfully to achieve their goals
