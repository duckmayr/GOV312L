## Free Expression and Free Exercise

. . .

- *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* highlighted how individuals' freedoms, such as the freedoms of speech and free exercise, can clash
- Expression restrictions must typically meet strict scrutiny
- However, there are exceptions and nuances, such as:
  + Content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions are okay
  + Some types of speech are less protected
    * Defamation laws are okay (with limits)
    * Speech inciting imminent lawless action can be restricted (*Brandenburg*)
    * "True" threats are not protected speech
- The First Amendment generally protects religious exercise
  + However, you must still follow "valid and neutral law[s] of general applicability" *Employment Division v. Smith*
  + Non-neutral laws must meet strict scrutiny

## Fulton v. City of Philadelphia

. . .

- Catholic Social Services (CSS) ran a foster care agency in Philadelphia
- CSS would not place foster children with same-sex couples
- In March of 2018, the Philadelphia Enquirer ran a story about it
- The City of Philadelphia stopped contracting with CSS
  + They said it violated a non-discrimination provision in their contract,
    plus the city's Fair Practices Ordinance
- CSS sued the city seeking renewal of their contract

## Fulton v. City of Philadelphia

. . .

- The Court unanimously held the city violated CSS's Free Exercise rights
  + The non-discrimination provisions allowed exceptions, at the "sole discretion" of the Commissioner
  + This ability meant it wasn't generally applicable, thus it doesn't fall under *Smith*
- Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas would have overruled *Smith*
- Justice Barrett, joined by Kavanaugh, also criticized *Smith* but agreed with the majority that it wasn't implicated

## Masterpiece Cake Shop v. CO Civil Rights Comm'n

. . .

- The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act prohibited discrimination on sexual orientation
- The owners of Masterpiece Cake Shop refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding
- The Colorado Civil Rights Commission found against the owners and ordered several corrective measures
- The Supreme Court was asked to find the CADA violated the First Amendment
- The Court somewhat punted, holding the Commission affirmatively illustrated animus during its proceedings against Masterpiece Cake Shop

## 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis

. . .

- Lorie Smith owned a design company, 303 Creative
- She wanted to move into wedding websites
- However, she did not want to make websites for same-sex weddings
- This implicated another conflict with CADA
- 303 Creative asked the Court to overturn *Smith*

## 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis

. . .

- The Court instead limited the case to Free Expression questions
- The Court held that Colorado can't force Smith "to create expressive designs speaking messages with which [she] disagrees"
- Sotomayor disagreed with the Court's view:
