## US v. Skrmetti

  + *The DOJ joined by transgender people, families, and doctors

## Barnes v. Felix

. . .

- In Harris County in 2016, Officer Felix pulled Barnes over
- After initial compliance, Barnes started to drive off
- Felix fatally shot Barnes
  + Felix grabbed onto the door frame
  + His head was above the car's roof, so he couldn't see inside
  + He pressed the gun to Barnes' head and fired, killing him
- Barnes' mother sued for excessive force
  + The trial court granted summary judgment for Felix
  + Cited "moment of threat" doctrine (*Harris v. Serpas*, 5th Cir. 2014)
    * You can only consider the moment of the shooting
    * You can't consider the officer's actions leading up to it
  + The Fifth Circuit affirmed
  + Oral arguments are on January 22, 2025

## Garland v VanDerStok

. . .

From the Gun Control Act of 1986 (GCA):

::: {.block}
### 18 U.S.C. \S 921(a)(3)
The term “firearm” means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon...
:::

::: {.nonincremental}
::: {.block}
### 18 U.S.C. \S 923
a) No person shall engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms... until he has... received a license to do so from the Attorney General...

<!-- -->

i) Licensed importers [and] manufacturers shall identify by means of a serial number... on the receiver or frame... in such manner as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe, each firearm imported or manufactured...
:::
:::

## Garland v. VanDerStok

. . .

- The GCA didn't define "frame or receiver"; ATF did by regulation
- This definition was outdated, & allowed the sale of "ghost guns"
  + They are also called privately made firearms or PMFs
  + Ghost guns are essentially parts kits to make a gun at home
- The ATF updated definitions by regulation
  + "Firearm" now includes any parts kit with a frame or receiver
  + "Frame or receiver" now has a very long, detailed definition
  + They added a definition of "readily"; it wasn't there before
    * "a process that is fairly or reasonably efficient, quick, and easy..."
    * relevant factors are "time, ease, expertise, equipment, availability, expense, scope, and feasibility"
- In combination, this requires ghost gun sellers to get an ATF license and add serial numbers

## Garland v. VanDerStok

. . .

- Ghost gun sellers challenged the new regulation
- The Court held [oral arguments](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2024/23-852) on October 8
- The government relied on arguments that
  + Regulations should uniformly apply to all firearms
    * Respondents noted intra-state secondary sales are not regulated
  + The purpose of the ATF is regulating access to firearms
- Opponents argued incomplete frames or receivers can't be regulated
  + Roberts and Barrett both did not seem to buy this at all

## Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton

. . .

- Texas passed a law requiring pornography websites to verify users' age
- A District Court granted an injunction against its enforcement
- The Fifth Circuit reversed and stayed the injunction
  + They argue regulations for *minors* only warrants "rational basis" review, not "strict scrutiny"
- First Amendment activists and interest groups argue the case has more far-reaching implications
- Oral arguments are on January 15, 2025
